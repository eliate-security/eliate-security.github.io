# eliate | fractional security engineering

## Security as Craftsmanship
eliate provides fractional security engineering. We embed a staff-level security engineer into your Slack, GitHub, and Cloud. We give high-velocity teams the expertise to ship complex systems securely, without the full-time headcount.

## The Model

### Consultant
Provides external advice that is often theoretical. Lacks the deep context of your codebase and operational realities.

### Full-Time Hire
Total immersion and hands-on execution, but often an excessive commitment and cost for early-stage security maturity.

### Fractional Security Engineer
Embedded expertise. We integrate directly into your engineering teams to provide staff-level leverage without the full-time headcount.
Security belongs in the pull request, not the slide deck. By operating within your technology stack, we provide consistent, high-leverage expertise that scales with your development velocity.

## The Philosophy
We approach security not as a checklist, but as a **quality attribute** of elegant engineering.

### 01. Velocity as Security
Friction implies safety, but velocity demands precision. We build the guardrails that enable rapid deployment, ensuring that security accelerates your roadmap rather than arresting it.

### 02. Engineering First
Effective governance is written in code, not prose. We express security controls through Terraform and CI/CD pipelines, embedding compliance directly into the infrastructure layer.

### 03. Precision Impact
Senior engineering guidance requires clarity, not volume. We provide focused, high-signal direction that resolves complexity, delivering specialised architectural guidance that is often hard to hire for full-time.

## Fractional Security Engineer
"With a decade of experience spanning deep telecoms research to high-velocity gaming startups, I view security as an integral component of system reliability."

Traditional advisory often separates strategy from execution. eliate. was founded to bridge that gap. I believe that the most effective security roadmap is one that accounts for the nuances of your specific architecture.

**I am an engineer first.** True value lies in implementation, refining IAM policies in Terraform, designing authentication flows alongside your developers, and treating security as a feature of your product quality.

When you engage with eliate., you are not hiring a roster. You are partnering directly with the craft.
